// As a developer, I want to add a sixth question to my guessing game that takes numeric input by prompting a user to guess a number (for instance, "What is my favorite number?" or "How many PokÃ©mon did I catch yesterday?"), and indicates to the user whether the guess is 'too high' or 'too low', and gives the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer, so that my fancy programming skills are showcased.

// var guessesLeft = 4;
// var secretNumber = 8;
//
// while (guessesLeft > 0) {
//   var guess = parseInt(prompt('Guess a number between 1 and 10!'));
//   if (guess === NaN) {
//     tell the user
//   } else if (too high) {
//     tell the user
//     reduce number of guesses remaining
//   } else if (too low) {
//     tell the user
//     reduce the guesses remaining
//   } else {
//     the must be correct
//     congratulate them

//   if (user runs out of tries) {
//     tell them

// As a developer, I want to add a seventh question to my guessing game that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array. For instance, "Can you guess a state that I have lived in besides Washington?", so that even more of my programming skills are showcased. For now, I will structure this question so that the user has six tries to get a single correct answer, and upon using up those tries OR getting a correct answer, displays a message to the user indicating all of the possible correct answers.

var guessesRemaining = 6;
var answers = ['Tennessee', 'Louisiana', 'New York', 'Montana', 'Alabama', 'Florida'];

while(guessesRemaining > 0) {
  var stateGuess = prompt('Can you guess a state I have lived in besides Washington?');
  guessesRemaining--;

  // for(var i = 0; i < answers.length; i++) {
  //   if(stateGuess === answers[i]){
  //     alert('Nice, you got one!');
  //     guessesRemaining = -1;
  //     break;
  //   }
  // }

  if(answers.includes(stateGuess)){
    alert('Nice, you got one!');
    guessesRemaining = -1;
  }

  if(guessesRemaining > 0){

  }

    alert('Sorry, you are out of guesses. My previous homes were Alabama, Florida, Tennesseee, Lousisiana, New York, and Montana.');
